    <summary>The CoreFoundation namespace provides low-level access to C-based CocoaTouch APIs.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
	The types in the MonoTouch.CoreFoundation namespace are
	bindings to the object oriented CocoaTouch C-API.  They are
	lower level classes, functions and types than the Objective-C
	based APIs found in MonoTouch.Foundation.
