    <summary>Base class for all bound objects that map to Objective-C objects.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
	This is the base class that is used to bind Objective-C classes
	to C# classes.  Merely subclassing from NSObject will produce a
	class that can be passed to Objective-C.   
      </para>
      <para>
	The C# NSObject class and their subclasses are managed
	representations of the underlying Objective-C instances.  The
	pointer to the unmanaged code Objective-C object is stored in
	the <see cref="P:Foundation.NSObject.Handle" />
	property.

      </para>
      <para>
	It is important to note that currently, the compiler does not
	support generic subclasses of NSObject.

        <h2>Class Registration</h2>
      </format>
      <para>
	When you create a subclass of NSObject this subclass is
	registered with the Objective-C runtime with a name based on
	the full .NET typename which is an implementation detail.  If
	you need to ensure that a C# class is exposed with a specific
	name in the Objective-C runtime, you can apply the <format type="text/html"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/search/index?search=T:ObjCRuntime.RegisterAttribute&amp;scope=Xamarin" title="T:ObjCRuntime.RegisterAttribute">T:ObjCRuntime.RegisterAttribute</a></format> to the
	class and specify the name that you want your class to have.

      </para>
      <para>
	The above is typically used in cases where either you want to
	reference the class by name on some Objective-C code, when
	using Interface Builder XIB and Storyboard files or when you
	are using an Objective-C serialization setup (for example when
	using <see cref="T:Foundation.NSCoder" />).

        <h2>Objective-C Methods</h2>
      </format>
      <para>
	In general, MonoTouch classes map one to one to the underlying
	Objective-C classes.  For example, the C# class
	"MonoTouch.Foundation.NSObject" maps to the Objective-C
	"NSObject" class.  But methods are different.  The Objective-C
	methods do not translate well to C# methods, so they have been
	in general been altered to match both the C# language, the C#
	idioms and the .NET Framework Design Guidelines.

	them.  This attribute is used by the compiler to map C# names
	to Objective-C names.  These attributes are shown in the API
	documentation on top of each function, to help you identify
	which Objective-C method a particular C# method is calling.

      </para>
      <para>
	To alter the behavior of a class you use the standard C#
	idioms: create a subclass and override the methods that you
	want to alter and use the "base." language feature to
	optionally call into your base class.

      </para>
      <example>
        <code lang="csharp lang-csharp"><![CDATA[
public class MyView : UISlider {
	public override void Draw (RectangleF rect)
	{
		// Let the base class draw first
		base.Draw (rect);
	
		// Our custom code

	public method.  And this can be done to both static and
	instance methods.  Once the attribute is applied, the method
	will be exposed to Objective-C and the standard data type

        <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
      </format>
      <para>
	The C# NSObject and their subclasses are managed wrappers for
	the underlying Objective-C object.  These are created either
	from C#, when you create a new instance by using the "new"
	operator or when an existing unmanaged object is surfaced to the C# world.
      </para>
      <para>
	When you create an object from C# using the "new" operator,
	the object will initially be owned by C#, and C# will retain a
	reference to the object.  This reference will only be dropped
	when the garbage collector determines that there are no
	pending managed references to it, or when you manually call
	the Dispose method on the object.

      </para>
      <para>
	C# NSObjects are also created on demand when you invoke a
	method or a property that returns an NSObject.  At this point,
	the runtime will look into an object cache and determine
	whether a given Objective-C NSObject has already been surfaced
	to the managed world or not.  If the object has been surfaced,
	the existing object will be returned, otherwise a constructor
	that takes an IntPtr as a parameter is invoked to construct
	the object.   

      </para>
      <para>
	Pure "peers" to framework objects (those objects
	that are merely C# representations of an Objective-C object
	and have no extra managed associated state) can be recreated
	by the runtime on demand by using the constructor mentioned before.   

      </para>
      <para>
	User-subclasses of NSObjects often contain C# state so
	whenever the Objective-C runtime performs a "retain" operation
	on one of these objects, the runtime creates a GCHandle that
	keeps the managed object alive, even if there are no C#
	visible references to the object.  This simplifies bookeeping
	a lot, since the state will be preserved automatically for
	you.

      </para>
      <para>
	The Dispose operation on an NSObject will always drop the
	reference to the underlying Objective-C object, but will not
	destroy the managed state, this will only happen when both the
	managed code and the unmanaged code have both released the
	objects.  This is slightly different from .NET, because on
	.NET once an object is disposed, it is not possible to invoke
	any methods on the object, as it is deemed to be useless.  That is not the case with NSObjects.

	In addition, you can use Key Paths to have the runtime

      <para> When using keypaths, if a lookup fails, the <see cref="M:Foundation.NSObject.SetValueForUndefinedKey(Foundation.NSObject,Foundation.NSString)" />

        <summary>Constructor to call on derived classes to skip initialization and merely allocate the object.</summary>
        <remarks>
          <para>This constructor should be called by derived classes when they completely construct the object in managed code and merely want the runtime to allocate and initialize the NSObject.   This is required to implement the two-step initialization process that Objective-C uses, the first step is to perform the object allocation, the second step is to initialize the object.   When developers invoke the constructor that takes the NSObjectFlag.Empty they take advantage of a direct path that goes all the way up to NSObject to merely allocate the object's memory and bind the Objective-C and C# objects together.    The actual initialization of the object is up to the developer.</para>
          <para>This constructor is typically used by the binding generator to allocate the object, but prevent the actual initialization to take place.   Once the allocation has taken place, the constructor has to initialize the object.   With constructors generated by the binding generator this means that it manually invokes one of the "init" methods to initialize the object.</para>
          <para>It is the developer's responsibility to completely initialize the object if they chain up using the NSObjectFlag.Empty path.</para>
          <para>In general, if the developer's constructor invokes the NSObjectFlag.Empty base implementation, then it should be calling an Objective-C init method.   If this is not the case, developers should instead chain to the proper constructor in their class. </para>
          <para>The argument value is ignored and merely ensures that the only code that is executed is the construction phase is the basic NSObject allocation and runtime type registration.  Typically the chaining would look like this:</para>

          <para>
	    You can override this method if you need your class to
	    respond to Objective-C's query to the object as to whether
	    it implements the specified protocol.
	  </para>
          <para>
	    You can compare the IntPtr value with the result of
	    creating an AdoptsAttribute with the specified protocol
	    and fetching its ProtocolHandle.
	  </para>
          <example>
            <code lang="csharp lang-csharp"><![CDATA[
static AdoptsAttribute myProtocol = new AdoptsAttribute ("MyProtocol");
public override ConformsToProtocol (IntPtr protocol)
{
	if (protocol == myProtocol.ProtocolHandle)
		return true;
	return false;
}
]]></code>
          </example>
          <para>
	    Although typically you would merely decorare your class
	    with the <see cref="T:ObjCRuntime.AdoptsAttribute" /> and let
	    the runtime do this for you, like this:
	  </para>
          <example>
            <code lang="csharp lang-csharp"><![CDATA[

          <para>
	    You use this method from a thread to invoke the code in
	    the specified object that is exposed with the specified
	    selector in the UI thread.  This is required for most
	    operations that affect UIKit or AppKit as neither one of
	    those APIs is thread safe.
	  </para>
          <para>
	    The code is executed when the main thread goes back to its
	    main loop for processing events.

          <para>
	    Unlike <see cref="M:Foundation.NSObject.BeginInvokeOnMainThread(ObjCRuntime.Selector,Foundation.NSObject)" />
	    this method waits for the main thread to execute the method, and does not return until the code pointed by action has completed.

      <Docs>
        <param name="keyPath">Key-path to use to perform the value lookup.   The keypath consists of a series of lowercase ASCII-strings with no spaces in them separated by dot characters.</param>
        <summary>Returns the value of a property that can be reached using a keypath.</summary>
        <returns>An NSObject containing the value for the specified keypath.</returns>
        <remarks>
          <para>
	    The keypath is separated by dots, and each component is
	    used to lookup a specific key on the object.  The process
	    is repeated on each returning object until the last
	    element is processed.  
	  </para>
          <para>
	    If a component of the key path is
	    not found, the method <see cref="M:Foundation.NSObject.ValueForUndefinedKey(Foundation.NSString)" />
	    is invoked, and its default implementation raises an
	    Objective-C exception.   Subclasses can alter this behavior by overriding that method.
