    <summary>Base class for all bound objects that map to Objective-C objects.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
	This is the base class that is used to bind Objective-C classes
	to C# classes.  Merely subclassing from NSObject will produce a
	class that can be passed to Objective-C.   
      </para>
      <para>

	The C# NSObject class and their subclasses are managed
	representations of the underlying Objective-C instances.  The
	pointer to the unmanaged code Objective-C object is stored in
	the <see cref="P:Foundation.NSObject.Handle" />
	property.

      </para>
      <para>
	
	It is important to note that currently, the compiler does not
	support generic subclasses of NSObject.

        <h2>Class Registration</h2>
      </format>
      <para>

	When you create a subclass of NSObject this subclass is
	registered with the Objective-C runtime with a name based on
	the full .NET typename which is an implementation detail.  If
	you need to ensure that a C# class is exposed with a specific
	name in the Objective-C runtime, you can apply the <see cref="T:ObjCRuntime.RegisterAttribute" /> to the
	class and specify the name that you want your class to have.

      </para>
      <para>

	The above is typically used in cases where either you want to
	reference the class by name on some Objective-C code, when
	using Interface Builder XIB and Storyboard files or when you
	are using an Objective-C serialization setup (for example when
	using <see cref="T:Foundation.NSCoder" />).

      </para>
      <example>
        <code lang="C#"><![CDATA[
//
// This exposes the C# class _MySampleView as the Objective-C MyView
//
[Export ("MyView")]
public class _MySampleView : UIView {

}

        <h2>Objective-C Methods</h2>
      </format>
      <para>
	
	In general, MonoTouch classes map one to one to the underlying
	Objective-C classes.  For example, the C# class
	"MonoTouch.Foundation.NSObject" maps to the Objective-C
	"NSObject" class.  But methods are different.  The Objective-C
	methods do not translate well to C# methods, so they have been
	in general been altered to match both the C# language, the C#
	idioms and the .NET Framework Design Guidelines.   

      </para>
      <para>

	Objective-C methods are surfaced to C# as virtual methods that
	have the special <see cref="T:ObjCRuntime.ExportAttribute" /> applied to
	them.  This attribute is used by the compiler to map C# names
	to Objective-C names.  These attributes are shown in the API
	documentation on top of each function, to help you identify
	which Objective-C method a particular C# method is calling.

      </para>
      <para>
	
	To alter the behavior of a class you use the standard C#
	idioms: create a subclass and override the methods that you
	want to alter and use the "base." language feature to
	optionally call into your base class.

      </para>
      <example>
        <code lang="C#"><![CDATA[
public class MyView : UISlider {
	public override void Draw (RectangleF rect)
	{
		// Let the base class draw first
		base.Draw (rect);
	
		// Our custom code
		var ctx = UIGraphics.GetCurrentContext ();
		UIColor.Gray.SetColor ();
		ctx.StrokeEllipseInRect (rect);
	}
}
]]></code>
      </example>
      <para>
	
	By default, only methods that have been overwritten will be
	exposed to the Objective-C world.  If you want to expose an
	arbitrary C# method to the Objective-C world, you need to
	apply the <see cref="T:ObjCRuntime.ExportAttribute" /> to your
	public method.  And this can be done to both static and
	instance methods.  Once the attribute is applied, the method
	will be exposed to Objective-C and the standard data type
	marshalling operations that are supported by the runtime are
	made available to those methods.

      </para>
      <example>
        <code lang="C#"><![CDATA[
//
// Exposes the class StringUtilities to Objective-C with the 
// method:
//    - (NSString *) joinArray:(NSArray *) stringArray withSeparator:(NSString *sep);
//
// Used like this:
//   id utilities = [[StringUtilities alloc] init];
//   NSLog (@"Joined: %@", [utilities joinArray:users withSeparator:@", "]);
//
public class StringUtilities : NSObject {
	[Export ("joinArray:withSeparator:")]
	public string Join (string [] array, string separator)
	{
		return string.Join (separator, array);
	}

        <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
      </format>
      <para>
	The C# NSObject and their subclasses are managed wrappers for
	the underlying Objective-C object.  These are created either
	from C#, when you create a new instance by using the "new"
	operator or when an existing unmanaged object is surfaced to the C# world.
      </para>
      <para>

	When you create an object from C# using the "new" operator,
	the object will initially be owned by C#, and C# will retain a
	reference to the object.  This reference will only be dropped
	when the garbage collector determines that there are no
	pending managed references to it, or when you manually call
	the Dispose method on the object.

      </para>
      <para>

	C# NSObjects are also created on demand when you invoke a
	method or a property that returns an NSObject.  At this point,
	the runtime will look into an object cache and determine
	whether a given Objective-C NSObject has already been surfaced
	to the managed world or not.  If the object has been surfaced,
	the existing object will be returned, otherwise a constructor
	that takes an IntPtr as a parameter is invoked to construct
	the object.   

      </para>
      <para>

	Pure "peers" to framework objects (those objects
	that are merely C# representations of an Objective-C object
	and have no extra managed associated state) can be recreated
	by the runtime on demand by using the constructor mentioned before.   

      </para>
      <para>

	User-subclasses of NSObjects often contain C# state so
	whenever the Objective-C runtime performs a "retain" operation
	on one of these objects, the runtime creates a GCHandle that
	keeps the managed object alive, even if there are no C#
	visible references to the object.  This simplifies bookeeping
	a lot, since the state will be preserved automatically for
	you.

      </para>
      <para>

	The Dispose operation on an NSObject will always drop the
	reference to the underlying Objective-C object, but will not
	destroy the managed state, this will only happen when both the
	managed code and the unmanaged code have both released the
	objects.  This is slightly different from .NET, because on
	.NET once an object is disposed, it is not possible to invoke
	any methods on the object, as it is deemed to be useless.  That is not the case with NSObjects. 

      </para>
      <format type="text/html">
        <h2>Adopting Protocols</h2>
      </format>
      <para>

	In MonoTouch, most Objective-C protocols are mapped to classes
	that have the <see cref="T:ObjCRuntime.ModelAttribute" /> applied to
	them.  And the way that you adopt a protocol is by subclassing
	and overwriting the methods that you want to adopt.

      </para>
      <para>

	There are some rare cases, where you want to adopt an ad-hoc
	protocol on your own.  If you need to adopt an Objective-C
	protocol, you should use the <see cref="T:ObjCRuntime.AdoptsAttribute" /> on your class
	and provide the name of the protocol that you want to adopt.
	Typically, when adopting a protocol, you will also have to
	list all of the Objective-C selectors that you are adopting
	using the <see cref="T:ObjCRuntime.ExportAttribute" />.

      </para>
      <example>
        <code lang="C#"><![CDATA[
[Adopts ("NSLocking")]
public class MyLockeingObject : NSObject {
	[Export ("lock")]
	public void Lock ()
	{
		// ...
	}

	[Export ("unlock")]
	public void Unlock ()
	{
		// ...
	}
}

        <h2>Key Value Coding</h2>
      </format>
      <para>
	Key Value coding is a mechanism that allows you to access
	properties of an object by their name, as opposed to accessing
	them directly with a C# method.
      </para>
      <para>

	To expose a C# property to the Key-Value coding system all you
	need to do is add the <see cref="T:ObjCRuntime.ExportAttribute" /> to your
	property. The names must only contain ASCII characters, start
	with a lowercase letter, and must not contain any spaces.

      </para>
      <example>
        <code lang="C#"><![CDATA[
public class CircleLayer : CALayer {
	[Export ("radius")]
	public double Radius { get; set; }

	// ...
}
]]></code>
      </example>
      <para>

	You use the <see cref="M:Foundation.ValueForKey(Foundation.NSString);" />
	to lookup a property using a name, and you use the of
	functions <see cref="M:Foundation.SetValueForKey(Foundation.NSObject,&#xA; Foundation.NSString);" /> to set the value for the
	specified property.  For example, you could call
	foo.ValueForKey ("user") to grab the value of the user
	property in an object.  

      </para>
      <para>

	In addition, you can use Key Paths to have the runtime
	repeatedly call the ValueForKey or SetValueForKey for you.
	You separate the keys by using a dot.  For example the keypath
	"user.address.phone.mobile" would request the user property,
	and then request the address property on the user, then it
	would request the phone property on the address and finally
	request the mobile property on the phone and finally use the
	result as the value.  You use the <see cref="M:Foundation.ValueForKeyPath(Foundation.NSString);" /> to lookup a property using
	a keypath, and you use the <see cref="M:Foundation.SetValueForKeyPath(Foundation.NSObject, Foundation.NSString);" /> to set a value using a
	keypath.

      </para>
      <para> When using keypaths, if a lookup fails, the <see cref="M:Foundation.NSObject.SetValueForUndefinedKey(Foundation.NSObject,Foundation.NSString)" />
	will be invoked when setting a value, and the <see cref="M:Foundation.NSObject.ValueForUndefinedKey(Foundation.NSString)" />
	will be invoked when looking up a value.  Both methods by
	default raise an Objective-C exception, you can alter that behavior by overriding the methods. 
	</para>
      <format type="text/html">
        <h2>Key Value Observing</h2>
      </format>
      <para>
	Key value observing is a mechanism implemented by NSObject
	that can be used to monitor changes being done to an NSObject
	through the Key Value Coding system.
      </para>
      <para>

	For your class to observe a notification, you must override
	the <see cref="M:Foundation.ObserveValue(Foundation.NSString,Foundation.NSObject,Foundation.NSDictionary,IntPtr)" />
	method which will be invoked with the information about the value changes for a specific keypath.   Then you use the <see cref="M:Foundation.AddObserver(Foundation.NSObject,Foundation.NSString,Foundation.NSKeyValueObservingOptions,IntPtr)" /> to start observing changes and the <see cref="M:Foundation.RemoveObserver(Foundation.NSObject,Foundation.NSString)" /> method to stop receiving notifications.

        <summary>Constructor to call on derived classes to skip initialization and merely allocate the object.</summary>
        <remarks>
          <para>This constructor should be called by derived classes when they completely construct the object in managed code and merely want the runtime to allocate and initialize the NSObject.   This is required to implement the two-step initialization process that Objective-C uses, the first step is to perform the object allocation, the second step is to initialize the object.   When developers invoke the constructor that takes the NSObjectFlag.Empty they take advantage of a direct path that goes all the way up to NSObject to merely allocate the object's memory and bind the Objective-C and C# objects together.    The actual initialization of the object is up to the developer.</para>
          <para>This constructor is typically used by the binding generator to allocate the object, but prevent the actual initialization to take place.   Once the allocation has taken place, the constructor has to initialize the object.   With constructors generated by the binding generator this means that it manually invokes one of the "init" methods to initialize the object.</para>
          <para>It is the developer's responsibility to completely initialize the object if they chain up using the NSObjectFlag.Empty path.</para>
          <para>In general, if the developer's constructor invokes the NSObjectFlag.Empty base implementation, then it should be calling an Objective-C init method.   If this is not the case, developers should instead chain to the proper constructor in their class. </para>
          <para>The argument value is ignored and merely ensures that the only code that is executed is the construction phase is the basic NSObject allocation and runtime type registration.  Typically the chaining would look like this:</para>
          <example>
            <code lang="C#"><![CDATA[
//
// The NSObjectFlag merely allocates the object and registers the
// C# class with the Objective-C runtime if necessary, but no actual

	    You can override this method if you need your class to
	    respond to Objective-C's query to the object as to whether
	    it implements the specified protocol.
	  </para>
          <para>
	    You can compare the IntPtr value with the result of
	    creating an AdoptsAttribute with the specified protocol
	    and fetching its ProtocolHandle.
	  </para>
          <example>
            <code lang="C#"><![CDATA[
static AdoptsAttribute myProtocol = new AdoptsAttribute ("MyProtocol");
public override ConformsToProtocol (IntPtr protocol)
{
	if (protocol == myProtocol.ProtocolHandle)
		return true;
	return false;
}
]]></code>
          </example>
          <para>
	    Although typically you would merely decorare your class
	    with the <see cref="T:ObjCRuntime.AdoptsAttribute" /> and let
	    the runtime do this for you, like this:
	  </para>
          <example>

	  This turns a regular peer object (one that has
	  IsDirectBinding set to true) into a toggleref object.  This
	  is necessary when you are storing to a backing field whose
	  objc_c semantics is not copy or retain.  This is an internal
	  method.

        <param name="keyPath">Key-path to use to perform the value lookup.   The keypath consists of a series of lowercase ASCII-strings with no spaces in them separated by dot characters.</param>
        <summary>Returns the value of a property that can be reached using a keypath.</summary>
        <returns>An NSObject containing the value for the specified keypath.</returns>
        <remarks>
          <para>
	    The keypath is separated by dots, and each component is
	    used to lookup a specific key on the object.  The process
	    is repeated on each returning object until the last
	    element is processed.  
	  </para>
          <para>
	    If a component of the key path is
	    not found, the method <see cref="M:Foundation.NSObject.ValueForUndefinedKey(Foundation.NSString)" />
	    is invoked, and its default implementation raises an
	    Objective-C exception.   Subclasses can alter this behavior by overriding that method.
