      <para> 

	Use AudioToolbox to create your own audio processing
	applications from the basic building blocks: <see cref="T:AudioToolbox.AudioFile" /> to read and write
	audio files, <see cref="T:AudioToolbox.AudioFileStream" /> to parse
	audio files progressively; And use the <see cref="T:AudioToolbox.InputAudioQueue" /> to record as
	well as <see cref="T:AudioToolbox.OutputAudioQueue" /> to play audio.

      <para>

	In addition to the low-level toolkit to create your own audio
	processing, the <see cref="T:AudioToolbox.SystemSound" /> can be used to
	play short audio clips.
