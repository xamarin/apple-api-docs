    <summary>The UserNotifications framework consolidates the delivery and handling of local and remote user notifications.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
        Starting in iOS 10 (Fall 2016), the APIs for local and remote notifications were refactored and consolidated in the UserNotifications framework. This framework allows notifications in a more consistent manner and with less chance of repetitive code.
